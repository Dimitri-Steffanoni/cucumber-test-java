## Cucumber Test Example (Java)

This repository showcases a practical example of behavioral testing using Cucumber and Java. It demonstrates how to define software behavior in plain, business-readable language using Gherkin syntax within `.feature` files. These specifications are then linked to executable Java code ("step definitions") that automates the testing process.

Cucumber reads these `.feature` files, executes the corresponding Java code for each step, and provides clear, concise test reports. This setup facilitates a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach, improving communication and collaboration across development, testing, and business teams.

Explore the repository to understand how to structure Cucumber tests in a Java project, write effective feature files, and implement robust step definitions.
